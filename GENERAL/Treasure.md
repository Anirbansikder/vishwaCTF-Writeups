# Find the room

Studying in VIIT(FV5M+VH) is one of the best experiences in my life... You need to be street smart in order to survive... I got called to the principals office one day, and couldn't find the room number(Yes!I am not very smart! and Nope!I don't belong here!) Can you help me find it? Maybe the room number is a flag

Go To Google Maps and see street view of FV5M+VH of VIIT .

You have been provided with a vm of a linux os, find the password of the root https://drive.google.com/file/d/14FnXZ1DiHgCFPKQF_hlZdAUAkaxzMX4J/view?usp=sharing

Download the VM and and run in Virtual Box ->

Open the directories and you will find a directory ```this is what you need``` . It contains wordlist . Try to access root with those passwords , the one that allows grant is the flag .
